## 1. Overview

This project utilizes Next.js as well as Server Side Rendering to update the page on each request after building. I followed best practices in Next.js and TypeScript as much as possible such as typing every component and object using in the application. I also avoided the use of the "any" type.

Below is a check list which encapsulates the major technical requirements given to me for the assignment:

:white_check_mark: Used Next.js with SSR

:white_check_mark: Used TypeScript without using "any"

:white_check_mark: Used Material-UI as much as possible

:white_check_mark: Used Docker node:14-buster-slim image to build app and deploy image

:white_check_mark: Implemented with Security (XSS, CSRF) in Mind

## 2. How to Start the Application

#### Locally

After cloning repository

```
    yarn && yarn run dev
```

## 3. Directory Structure

I have structured the folders and named the files to keep as much as I can to the Domain-Driven Design philosophy.

#### Pages

To keep the directory structure as easy to follow as possible I have separated the 2 pages (item-list and [editId] which is a dynamic route page) into their respective directories and used css modules.

The API routes for performing CRUD operations can be seen here as well.

```
ğŸ“¦pages
â”£ ğŸ“‚api
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œadd-item.ts
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œdelete-item.ts
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œupdate-item.ts
â”£ ğŸ“‚item-list
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œindex.module.css
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œindex.tsx
â”£ ğŸ“‚[editId]
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œeditItem.module.css
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œindex.tsx
â”£ ğŸ“œindex.tsx
â”— ğŸ“œ_app.tsx
```

#### Components

Layout concerns like the main navigation and the pages layout are addressed in the layout folder, in keeping with convention. Small elements that were reused multiple times were extracted into the `elements` folder and the larger reusable form in its own folder.

```
ğŸ“¦components
â”£ ğŸ“‚elements
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œFormButton.tsx
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œFormDateTimePicker.tsx
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œFormTextInput.tsx
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œItemCard.tsx
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œItemCheckbox.tsx
â”£ ğŸ“‚form
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œForm.tsx
â”— ğŸ“‚layout
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œLayout.module.css
â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œLayout.tsx
â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œMainNav.tsx
```

#### types

To help with type-checking and debugging, I have a `todoItem.ts` that exports the type which represents the todo item object. This directory is on the same level as the `pages` and `components` directories.

```
ğŸ“¦types
 â”— ğŸ“œtodoItem.ts
```

```
import { ObjectId } from "mongodb";

export type todoItem = {
  _id: ObjectId | null;
  content: string;
  dueDate: Date | null;
  status: string;
};
```

#### utils

The snippet for connecting to the database is exported from the `connection.ts` file in the `utils` directory for reusability. This directory just like the one mentioned above is on the same level as the `pages` and `components` directories.

```
ğŸ“¦utils
â”— ğŸ“œconnection.ts
```

## 4. Security Measures

- To prevent XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking and MIME sniffing vulnerabilities, I have include HTTP response headers in `next.config.js` to deny other sources from being able to take advantage of these

Denying MIME sniffing makes it harder to perform CSRF through malicious file upload.

- The database that this project utilizes is built on AWS cloud infrastructure using MongoDB Atlas. MongoDB Atlas makes managing many aspects of a database, such as administration and security quite easy. The advantage of using this database environment is that the infrastructure is very secure from the get-go as these are big cloud and database companies that offer security from threats like DDOS and XSS attacks along with their offerings guaranteeing, if used responsibly, a high level of safety and reliability.
